### Intro
Simple ReAct agent implemented in langchain.

Uses the wikipedia to search for information and perform actions based on the observations.

I am using [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) for this project.

I installed `wikipedia`, `langchain`, `openai`, and `python-dotenv` to load environmental variables.
